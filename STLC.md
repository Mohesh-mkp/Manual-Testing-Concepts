### âœ… STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)

**STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)** is a **systematic process** that defines all the **activities carried out by testers** to ensure the quality of the software. It starts as soon as the requirements are defined and continues until the software is released.

While **SDLC** covers the whole software development, **STLC focuses only on testing**.

## ðŸ”„ **Phases of STLC (Brief Explanation)**

| Phase                         | Description                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Requirement Analysis**   | Review and understand the testing requirements. Clarify doubts with stakeholders. Identify what to test. |
| **2. Test Planning**          | Create a test plan. Define scope, objectives, resources, schedule, test types, and responsibilities.     |
| **3. Test Case Design**       | Write test cases and test scenarios. Prepare test data. Cover both positive and negative flows.          |
| **4. Test Environment Setup** | Prepare hardware/software/test tools to execute test cases. Often done with dev or DevOps support.       |
| **5. Test Execution**         | Run the test cases. Log defects if actual results differ from expected results.                          |
| **6. Test Cycle Closure**     | Analyze test results, prepare test summary report, assess quality, and learn from the testing process.   |

## ðŸ§  Key Points:

* STLC helps in improving **test coverage**, **quality**, and **traceability**.
* Each phase has **entry and exit criteria**.
* STLC is followed in both **manual and automation testing**.

## ðŸ“Œ Simple Example:

Imagine you are testing an e-commerce app:

1. **Requirement Analysis**: Login, Cart, and Checkout need to be tested.
2. **Test Planning**: Decide test strategy, who will test what, and how many cycles.
3. **Test Case Design**: Write test cases like "Verify login with valid credentials".
4. **Test Environment Setup**: Set up Android emulator and backend server.
5. **Test Execution**: Run tests and log bugs like "checkout fails for COD".
6. **Test Cycle Closure**: Create a report, share insights, and close testing cycle.
