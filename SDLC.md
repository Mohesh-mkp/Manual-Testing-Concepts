### âœ…SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

**SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)** is a **structured process** used to **develop, test, and deploy** software systems efficiently and with quality. It provides a **step-by-step framework** for planning, creating, testing, and maintaining software.

## ðŸ”„ **Phases of SDLC (Brief Overview)**

| Phase                                   | Description                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Requirement Gathering & Analysis** | Understand what the client wants. Collect functional and non-functional requirements. |
| **2. System Design**                    | Design the software architecture, user interfaces, and system components.             |
| **3. Implementation / Coding**          | Developers write code according to the design and requirements.                       |
| **4. Testing**                          | Testers verify that the software meets the requirements and is bug-free.              |
| **5. Deployment**                       | The application is deployed to a live environment for users to access.                |
| **6. Maintenance**                      | Fixing post-release bugs, updating software, and supporting users.                    |

## ðŸ’¡ Key Points:

* Each phase has entry and exit criteria.
* It ensures **quality**, **cost-effectiveness**, and **time management**.
* SDLC is used in **Waterfall, Agile, V-Model, Spiral**, and other development models.

## ðŸ“Œ Real-World Analogy:

Think of SDLC like building a house:

1. Plan what kind of house you want (Requirements)
2. Draw the blueprint (Design)
3. Build the house (Coding)
4. Inspect the house (Testing)
5. Move in (Deployment)
6. Fix any plumbing/electricity issues later (Maintenance)
