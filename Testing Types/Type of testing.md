**Functional Testing** and **Non-Functional Testing** are the **two main categories of software testing**.

---

## ✅ Functional Testing

Functional testing checks **what the system does** — whether it behaves **according to the requirements**.

### 🔍 Focus:

* Business logic
* User actions
* Data input/output
* Features

### 🧪 Common Types:

| Type                  | Purpose                            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Unit Testing          | Test individual code units         |
| Integration Testing   | Test modules working together      |
| System Testing        | Test complete system functionality |
| Sanity Testing        | Quick checks on new builds         |
| Smoke Testing         | Basic health checks                |
| Regression Testing    | Ensure no existing features broke  |
| User Acceptance (UAT) | Confirm system meets user needs    |

### 💡 Example:

Test that a user can **login** with a valid username and password, and gets an error for invalid credentials.

## ✅ Non-Functional Testing

Non-functional testing checks **how the system performs**, not what it does.

### 🔍 Focus:

* Performance
* Security
* Usability
* Reliability
* Scalability

### 🧪 Common Types:

| Type                    | Purpose                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Performance Testing     | How fast/efficient the app runs            |
| Load Testing            | App behavior under expected user load      |
| Stress Testing          | App behavior under extreme/unexpected load |
| Security Testing        | Find vulnerabilities or breaches           |
| Usability Testing       | Check how user-friendly the app is         |
| Compatibility Testing   | Runs on different browsers, devices, OSs   |
| Reliability Testing     | Stable functioning over time               |
| Maintainability Testing | Ease of updates or bug fixes               |

### 💡 Example:

Check that the **website loads within 2 seconds** even with 100 users logged in.

| Category               | Tests "What system does" | Tests "How system behaves" |

| Functional Testing     | ✅                        | ❌                          |
| Non-Functional Testing | ❌                        | ✅                          |
