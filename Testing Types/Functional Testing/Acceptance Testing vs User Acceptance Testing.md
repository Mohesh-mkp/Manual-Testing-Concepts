While **Acceptance Testing** and **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** are closely related and often overlap, they are **not exactly the same**. Here's the **difference between Acceptance Testing and User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** explained clearly:

---

## ✅ **Acceptance Testing (Broad Term)**

### 📌 **Definition**:

A **high-level testing phase** performed **after system testing**, to ensure the software meets **business requirements and is ready for deployment**.

### 🎯 **Goal**:

To validate the **overall system’s compliance** with requirements (technical + business).

### 👨‍🔧 **Performed By**:

* Can be done by **testers**, **product owners**, or **business analysts**.
* May include various subtypes like:

  * **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**
  * **Alpha Testing**
  * **Beta Testing**
  * **Contract Acceptance Testing**

---

## 👥 **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**

### 📌 **Definition**:

A **specific type of Acceptance Testing**, where **end users** (clients or business stakeholders) verify that the system works for their **real-world needs**.

### 🎯 **Goal**:

To ensure the software is **usable and acceptable to the end users** in real-world business scenarios.

### 👩‍💼 **Performed By**:

* Actual **end users**, **clients**, or **business stakeholders**.

## 🧠 **Key Differences:**

| Feature         | **Acceptance Testing**                                    | **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**                    |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 📌 Scope        | Broader – can include multiple types of acceptance        | Specific – focused only on user/business validation  |
| 👤 Performed By | Testers, product owners, or business analysts             | **End users or clients**                             |
| 🎯 Objective    | Ensure system meets **business & technical requirements** | Ensure system is **usable & acceptable** to the user |
| 🛠️ Based On    | Functional specs, business requirements                   | **Real-world user scenarios and workflows**          |
| 🧪 Includes     | UAT, Alpha, Beta, Regulatory, Contract Testing            | A subset of Acceptance Testing                       |

## 💡 **Simple Example:**

* ✅ **Acceptance Testing**:
  QA team checks that the invoice system calculates tax and totals correctly based on business rules.

* ✅ **UAT**:
  A finance manager tests the invoice system using **real client data** to make sure it works in **their actual workflow**.
