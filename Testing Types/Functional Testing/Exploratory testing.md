## ✅ **What is Exploratory Testing?**

**Exploratory Testing** is a **simultaneous learning, test design, and execution process** where testers explore the application **without predefined test cases**, using their own creativity, intuition, and domain knowledge.

🔍 It focuses on:

* Finding bugs that scripted tests might miss
* Exploring the application like a real user
* Uncovering usability and functional issues

---

## 🎯 **Purpose of Exploratory Testing:**

* Discover **unexpected bugs** quickly
* Learn the application behavior by using it directly
* Find **edge cases** that may not be covered in documentation

---

## 👤 **Who Performs It?**

* Experienced testers or domain experts
* Testers who are familiar with the application's business logic

---

## 📘 **Example:**

Suppose you're testing a **flight booking application**.

Instead of following a test script, you might:

* Try booking a flight without selecting a destination
* Use special characters in the passenger name field
* Navigate quickly between pages to see if it crashes
* Try accessing the payment page without logging in

🧠 You’re using your **instinct and understanding** to uncover issues in real-world scenarios.
