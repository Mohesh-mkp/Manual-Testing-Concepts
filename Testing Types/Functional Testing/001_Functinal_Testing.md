## ✅ What is Functional Testing?

**Functional Testing** is a type of software testing that **verifies each function of an application works according to the requirements or specifications**.

> It checks **"what the system does"**, not how it does it.

---

## 🧪 Key Focus:

* Input → Processing → Output
* **UI behavior**, **APIs**, **Databases**, **Security**, and **user flows**
* Based on **business logic** and **expected outcomes**

---

## 🛠️ Techniques Used:

* **Black-box testing** (testers don’t need to know internal code)
* **Test cases** are written using **requirements documents**, **user stories**, or **acceptance criteria**

---

## 👤 Who performs it?

* QA Testers
* Sometimes Developers (as part of unit or integration tests)

---

## 💡 Example:

### Scenario: Online Banking Application

**Test Case for Functional Testing**:

> When a user logs in with correct username and password → They should be redirected to their account dashboard.

You would verify:

* Login page loads
* Input fields accept valid data
* Correct credentials log the user in
* Incorrect credentials show error messages

✅ If all these work as intended → Functional Test **Passes**
