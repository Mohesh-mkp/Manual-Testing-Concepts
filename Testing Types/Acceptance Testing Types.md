### ðŸ“Œ What it is:

**Internal testing** done **before the product is released to users**, often to catch bugs early.

### ðŸ‘¤ Performed by:

QA team, developers, or internal testers of the company.

### ðŸ’¡ Example:

An in-house QA team tests a messaging app internally before opening it to public users.

## âœ… 5. **Beta Testing**

### ðŸ“Œ What it is:

Testing done by **real users in a real environment** before the final product release.

### ðŸ‘¤ Performed by:
