### Non-Functional Testing?

**Non-Functional Testing** is a type of software testing that checks **how well** a system performs under various conditions, rather than what it does.

It focuses on the **quality attributes** of the system such as:

* Performance
* Usability
* Reliability
* Security
* Scalability
* Compatibility

---

### 🧠 Key Point:

> **It answers**: "How *well* does the system work?"
> **Not**: "What does the system do?"

---

### 🔍 Example:

Imagine a shopping website:

* ✅ Functional Test: Can the user add a product to the cart?
* 🚀 Non-Functional Test: Can the website handle 10,000 users at the same time without crashing?

### 📚 Common Types of Non-Functional Testing:

| Type                      | Description                                             | Example                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Performance Testing**   | Checks how fast the system responds under load          | Page loads under 2 seconds during peak traffic   |
| **Load Testing**          | Tests system behavior under expected user load          | 1000 users logging in at once                    |
| **Stress Testing**        | Checks how system handles **extreme** load              | Pushing the server until it crashes              |
| **Usability Testing**     | Measures how easy and intuitive the system is for users | Is the app easy for new users to navigate?       |
| **Security Testing**      | Identifies vulnerabilities and data protection flaws    | Can unauthorized users access private data?      |
| **Compatibility Testing** | Checks system’s behavior across different environments  | App works on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari         |
| **Scalability Testing**   | Measures the system’s ability to scale up               | Can we increase capacity by adding more servers? |
| **Reliability Testing**   | Checks whether system runs without failure over time    | Application remains stable during 24-hour usage  |

### ✅ When is Non-Functional Testing Done?

* Usually performed **after functional testing** is complete.
* Especially important **before production** or release.
* Often executed using **automated tools** (e.g., JMeter for performance).

---

### 🧪 Real-Life Analogy:

* **Functional**: A car has a brake, steering, accelerator (they *work*).
* **Non-Functional**: The car can go 0–100 km/h in 6 seconds, has good mileage, and is comfortable to drive (it *performs well*).
