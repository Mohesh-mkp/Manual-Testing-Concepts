## ✅ **What is Ad-hoc Testing?**

**Ad-hoc Testing** is an informal and unstructured form of software testing where test cases are **not planned or documented in advance**. Testers rely on their **intuition, experience, and understanding** of the application to find defects.

## 🔍 **Key Points:**

| Aspect            | Details                                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Objective**     | Find defects through **random, unscripted interactions** |
| **When Done**     | Usually performed **after formal testing** is complete   |
| **Documentation** | No prior test cases or documentation                     |
| **Tester Skill**  | Requires good understanding of the application           |
| **Tools Used**    | None typically; done manually                            |

## 🎯 **Purpose:**

* To find **hidden or missed bugs** that are not covered in formal testing
* To simulate **unexpected user behavior**
* To provide a **fresh perspective** on the system

---

## 📘 **Example:**

You are testing a **shopping app**.

Instead of following a test script, you try:

* Adding 1000+ items to the cart
* Removing items rapidly while checking out
* Using emoji in the address field
* Going back and forth between payment screens

These random interactions might cause **unexpected crashes or bugs**, which are often missed in scripted testing.

## 🧩 **Common Types That Fall Under Ad-hoc Testing:**

| Type                | Description                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Monkey Testing**  | Random inputs without logic              |
| **Gorilla Testing** | Repeated testing on one feature/module   |
| **Donkey Testing**  | Careless or brute-force style of testing |

## 🧠 Summary:

| Feature      | Ad-hoc Testing                    |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Test Design  | No planning or documentation      |
| Approach     | Random, intuitive, unscripted     |
| Advantage    | Quick bug discovery               |
| Disadvantage | Hard to reproduce or track issues |
