## ✅ **What is User Acceptance Testing (UAT)?**

**User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** is the **final phase of software testing**, where the **actual users** (or clients) test the software to ensure it meets their **business requirements** and is ready for release.

It is also known as:

* End-User Testing
* Beta Testing
* Application Testing

---

## 🎯 **Purpose of UAT:**

* Verify that the software works as intended **in real-world scenarios**
* Ensure the system supports **business workflows**
* Identify any missing features, usability issues, or gaps before go-live

---

## 🔍 **When is UAT Done?**

* After **System Testing** is complete
* Before the product is **moved to production**

---

## 🔧 **Who Performs UAT?**

* **End users**
* **Clients**
* Sometimes **business analysts or domain experts**

---

## 📘 **Example:**

Let’s say a company developed a **Leave Management System** for HR.

During UAT, the **HR team** checks:

* Can they log in and submit a leave request? ✅
* Can managers approve/reject leave? ✅
* Is leave balance updated correctly after approval? ✅
* Does the email notification work for leave approval? ✅

If all these match their business process and expectations, the system **passes UAT** and is **ready for deployment**.
