## ✅ **What is System Testing?**

**System Testing** is a type of software testing where the **entire application** is tested as a complete system to verify that it meets the **specified requirements**.

It checks:

* Functionality
* Performance
* Security
* Compatibility
* User experience

📌 This is done **after Integration Testing** and **before User Acceptance Testing (UAT).**

---

## 🎯 **Purpose of System Testing:**

* To ensure the software **works correctly end-to-end**
* To validate both **functional and non-functional requirements**
* To test from the **user’s point of view**

---

## 👥 **Who Performs It?**

* QA testers (not developers or end-users)

---

## 🔍 **Types of Testing under System Testing:**

* Functional Testing
* Non-functional Testing (e.g., performance, usability, load)
* Regression Testing
* Smoke & Sanity Testing

---

## 📘 **Example:**

Suppose you're testing a **Food Delivery App**.

In System Testing, you would check:

* Login and signup flows ✅
* Restaurant search functionality ✅
* Adding items to the cart ✅
* Payment gateway ✅
* Order tracking system ✅
* Email and SMS notifications ✅

You test the entire system **as a whole**, just like a real user would.
