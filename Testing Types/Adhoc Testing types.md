## ‚úÖ **What is Ad-hoc Testing?**

Ad-hoc testing is an informal and unstructured way of testing where testers explore the application **without predefined test cases**, relying on their **intuition and experience** to uncover defects.

## üîÑ **When is Ad-hoc Testing Done?**

| When                                     | Why                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| After formal test cases are executed     | To find defects missed by scripted testing   |
| When time is limited                     | Quick, focused testing without documentation |
| During early builds or unstable releases | To catch obvious, early-stage bugs           |
| Before release (last-minute testing)     | To ensure edge cases are handled properly    |

## üîç **Types of Ad-hoc Testing**

| Type                | Description                                                                                      | Example                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Monkey Testing**  | Random inputs and actions, without logic                                                         | Entering random characters into every field                                     |
| **Gorilla Testing** | Focusing heavily on one feature/module with repeated actions                                     | Uploading the same file multiple times to test file upload                      |
| **Buddy Testing**   | Two testers (often a developer + tester) test together to share knowledge and explore the system | Tester and developer test the login functionality together                      |
| **Pair Testing**    | Two testers work collaboratively on the same system                                              | One tester drives, the other observes and suggests                              |
| **Donkey Testing**  | Informal term used for careless or brute-force testing with minimal planning                     | Randomly clicking buttons and navigating screens without understanding the flow |

## üß† **Quick Comparison Table**

| Type            | Planning | Collaboration  | Scope            | Focus Area          |
| --------------- | -------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Monkey Testing  | None     | No             | Entire app       | Random behavior     |
| Gorilla Testing | None     | No             | One module       | Repetition strength |
| Buddy Testing   | Low      | Yes (Dev + QA) | Multiple modules | Knowledge sharing   |
| Pair Testing    | Low      | Yes (QA + QA)  | Specific areas   | Exploratory & fast  |
| Donkey Testing  | None     | No             | Random           | Careless/random use |

## üìå Summary

* **Ad-hoc Testing** is useful when formal testing is done, or time is short.
* It helps catch **unexpected bugs** and edge cases.
* Works best when testers have a good understanding of the app.
