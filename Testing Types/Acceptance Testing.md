## ✅ What is Acceptance Testing?

**Acceptance Testing** is a type of software testing performed to determine whether the system meets the **business requirements** and is **ready for delivery to the customer**.

> 💬 It answers the question:
> *"Does the software work the way the customer expects it to?"*

## 🕒 When is it Done?

* ✔️ After **System Testing** is completed
* ✔️ Before **Go-Live / Deployment**
* ✔️ Often the **final phase** of testing before release

## 👤 Who Performs It?

* Usually performed by:

  * **Clients**
  * **End Users**
  * **Product Owners**
  * Or sometimes by a **QA team on behalf of users**

---

## 🎯 Purpose of Acceptance Testing

* ✅ Verify if all **business and user requirements** are met
* ✅ Ensure system is **acceptable** for real-world usage
* ✅ Get final **approval** before release

## 💡 Example:

### 🛒 Application: E-commerce Website

**Requirement**: User should be able to place an order and get email confirmation.

### In Acceptance Testing:

* The **client logs in**, adds items to cart, applies a discount coupon, places the order, and checks the confirmation email.
* They validate:

  * Cart works
  * Discounts are applied correctly
  * Order is placed
  * Email is received

> ✅ If everything works as expected → **System is accepted**
