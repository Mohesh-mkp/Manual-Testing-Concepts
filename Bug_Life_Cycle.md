### ✅ **What is a Bug or Defect?**

**Answer:**
A bug or defect is an error, flaw, or fault in a software program that causes it to produce incorrect or unexpected results.

---

Certainly! Here's a **detailed explanation of the Bug Life Cycle** (also known as **Defect Life Cycle**) with a clear **example** to help you understand each stage.

---

## 🐞 **Bug Life Cycle – Overview**

The **Bug Life Cycle** is the journey of a bug/defect from its initial discovery to its final closure. This lifecycle ensures proper tracking, fixing, retesting, and verifying of the issue.

---

## 🧭 **Bug Life Cycle Stages**

| Stage           | Description                                                             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. New**      | A bug is discovered and logged by the tester. It awaits triage.         |
| **2. Assigned** | The bug is assigned to a developer by the test lead or project manager. |
| **3. Open**     | The developer starts analyzing and working on the defect.               |
| **4. Fixed**    | The developer fixes the issue and marks it as fixed.                    |
| **5. Retest**   | The tester retests the bug in the next build to verify the fix.         |
| **6. Verified** | The tester confirms the bug is resolved and marks it as verified.       |
| **7. Closed**   | The test lead or tester closes the bug after verification.              |

### 🌀 Optional Stages:

| Stage                | Description                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Rejected**         | Developer disagrees with the bug (e.g., not a bug, duplicate, or as-designed). |
| **Deferred**         | The bug is valid but fixed later (low priority or time constraints).           |
| **Duplicate**        | Bug is already reported.                                                       |
| **Cannot Reproduce** | Developer/tester is unable to reproduce the issue with given steps.            |
| **Reopened**         | Bug reappears after being marked fixed/verified/closed.                        |

## 🧑‍💻 **Real-World Example of a Bug Life Cycle**

### 🟢 Scenario:

Tester finds that clicking the "Submit" button on a form **does not show a confirmation message**.

---

### 🔁 Step-by-Step Walkthrough:

1. **New**:
   The tester logs the defect in the bug tracking tool (e.g., JIRA).

   * **Bug ID**: #BUG-101
   * **Title**: "Submit button does not show confirmation"
   * **Status**: New

2. **Assigned**:
   Test Lead assigns the bug to a frontend developer.

   * **Assigned To**: John (Frontend Dev)
   * **Status**: Assigned

3. **Open**:
   John starts analyzing the code and discovers that a `success message` call is missing in the JavaScript code.

   * **Status**: Open

4. **Fixed**:
   John fixes the code and commits the changes.

   * **Status**: Fixed
   * **Comments**: "Added missing success message function call."

5. **Retest**:
   The tester retests the "Submit" functionality in the next build and sees the message appearing correctly.

   * **Status**: Retest

6. **Verified**:
   The tester confirms that the fix works and marks it as verified.

   * **Status**: Verified

7. **Closed**:
   The test lead or tester changes the status to **Closed** as the issue is resolved.

   * **Status**: Closed

### ✅ What is a **Deferred Bug**?

A **Deferred bug** is a defect that has been **acknowledged** by the development team but is **postponed** to be fixed **in a future release**, rather than the current build. This decision is usually made when the bug is:

* Low priority or low severity
* Doesn’t impact core functionality
* Too risky or costly to fix now
* Related to features that are being redesigned or deprecated

---

### 🧠 **Example of a Deferred Bug:**

Let’s say you're testing a mobile app that includes a "Help" section. You find that the **“Contact Us” form crashes** if the user clicks “Submit” without typing anything.

* The bug is **valid**.
* However, the feature is being **redesigned** in the next sprint.
* The release is focused on **critical payment-related issues**.
* So the team decides to **defer** fixing this to the next release.

---

### 🧪 **How Should a Tester Handle This Situation?**

Let’s walk through what a **tester should do** if a bug is deferred, but the **developer or team is not agreeing to fix it immediately**:

---

#### ✅ **Step-by-Step Response:**

---

### 🧩 1. **Understand the Reason for Deferral**

Ask or confirm:

* Why is this being deferred?
* Is the feature being removed, redesigned, or considered non-critical?
* Is there a business justification?

**Example**:

> “The bug in the ‘Contact Us’ form is known, but we’re revamping the Help section in the next release, so we’ll fix it then.”

---

### 📄 2. **Document Everything Clearly**

In your **bug tracking tool (e.g., JIRA, Bugzilla)**:

* Set the status as **Deferred**
* Add proper **comments or tags** like `Planned in Sprint 25`
* Mention the decision-maker or reason for deferral

> `Deferred due to Help module redesign scheduled for Q4 Sprint.`

---

### 🧠 3. **Provide Risk Analysis (If Needed)**

If you believe the bug **should not be deferred**, back it with:

* Business impact (e.g., user frustration, data loss, crash)
* User priority (e.g., part of onboarding or help flow)
* Regression risk

**Example:**

> "This may seem minor, but if new users try to get support and see the app crash, it could affect onboarding and user retention."

---

### ⚖️ 4. **Negotiate and Escalate Professionally**

If developers are refusing to fix and it feels like a critical issue:

* Bring it up in **daily stand-up** or sprint planning
* Ask the **Product Owner** or **QA lead** to review it
* Provide **user perspective** or **analytics** (if available)

---

### ✅ 5. **Retest in Future Release**

Once deferred:

* **Tag** it for retesting
* Add it to **regression checklist** for the future release
* Confirm that it is tracked and **not forgotten**

---

### 🗂️ Summary:

| Situation                    | Tester Action                                |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Bug is deferred              | Document clearly, add reason and version tag |
| Developer disagrees to fix   | Back with impact and business case           |
| Stakeholder decision pending | Escalate via stand-up, QA lead, or PO        |
| Future version planned       | Include in future regression testing         |

---

### ✅ How to deal a **Rejected Bug** with **won't fix** reason?

---

## 🛑 What does “**Won’t Fix**” mean?

A **"Won’t Fix"** status means the development team **acknowledges the issue**, but has **decided not to fix it** due to **business, technical, or priority reasons**.

---

## 🎯 Common Reasons for “Won’t Fix”:

1. 🔧 **Low Impact**: The bug has minimal or no impact on functionality or user experience.
2. ⏳ **Time Constraints**: No time in the current sprint/release cycle.
3. 📉 **Business Decision**: Stakeholders don’t consider the fix necessary for business goals.
4. 🔄 **Will Be Deprecated**: The affected module/page will be removed or rewritten.
5. 🧪 **Edge Case**: Happens in rare conditions that don’t reflect real-world use.
6. 🖥️ **Third-Party Limitation**: Issue lies in external tool/library that can’t be fixed internally.

---

## ✅ **How to Respond or Deal with “Won’t Fix” Bugs**

### 1. 🔍 **Understand the Reason Clearly**

* Read the developer's or manager’s comment.
* If unclear, politely ask:
  *"Can you please elaborate why this is marked as 'Won’t Fix'? I want to ensure we're aligned on the impact and scope."*

---

### 2. 🧾 **Re-validate the Issue**

* Double-check the bug:

  * Is it reproducible?
  * Is the impact minor or major?
  * Are users affected?
* If it’s **not critical**, the “Won’t Fix” might be valid.

---

### 3. 📣 **Communicate with the Product Owner or BA**

* If you disagree with the rejection:

  * Escalate to **Business Analyst**, **Product Owner**, or **Test Lead**.
  * Explain the **impact** on user experience or functionality.
  * Provide **screenshots or evidence** supporting your point.

---

### 4. 📊 **Document Everything**

* Update the bug comment thread:

  * "Developer marked this as Won’t Fix. According to XYZ testing, this affects \[module/page], and the impact is \[describe briefly]."
  * Link relevant logs, screenshots, or test cases.
* If everyone agrees, close it. If not, reopen with justification.

---

### 5. 🔁 **Accept the Decision (if Valid)**

* Even if you disagree, **respect the final decision** once it's been discussed.
* Focus on critical areas that need attention.

---

## 💬 Example Conversation

**Developer**:

> Marking this bug as “Won’t Fix” since it only occurs when the user clicks “Back” rapidly 10+ times, which is unlikely.

**Tester**:

> Thanks for the update. Noted that this is an edge case. I’ll mark it as verified based on business input.

Or, if you want to escalate:

**Tester**:

> I understand it’s an edge case, but this affects the checkout flow. I’ve escalated to the PO for decision as it may impact real users under slow network conditions.

---

## 📌 Best Practices

* Stay professional and respectful.
* Focus on **collaboration**, not confrontation.
* Provide **data, logs, evidence** instead of emotions.
* Keep your **test lead in loop** if it becomes a pattern.
