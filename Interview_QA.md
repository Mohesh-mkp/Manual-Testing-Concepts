### ✅ Manual Testing

---

### ✅ **1. What is Software Testing?**

**Answer:**
Software Testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software application or system meets the specified requirements and works as expected. It helps identify defects or bugs in the software.

---

### ✅ **2. What is Manual Testing?**

**Answer:**
Manual Testing is a type of software testing where test cases are executed manually without the use of any automation tools. It involves the tester playing the role of an end user and using most of the application's features.

---

### ✅ **3. What is a Test Case?**

**Answer:**
A test case is a set of actions executed to verify a particular feature or functionality of the application. It includes test steps, test data, expected results, and actual results.

---

### ✅ **4. What is a Bug or Defect?**

**Answer:**
A bug or defect is an error, flaw, or fault in a software program that causes it to produce incorrect or unexpected results.

### ✅ **5. What is the Difference Between Verification and Validation?**

| **Verification**                                              | **Validation**                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ensures the product is built correctly (as per design specs). | Ensures the right product is built (meets business needs). |
| Involves static testing (e.g., reviews).                      | Involves dynamic testing (e.g., execution of software).    |

### ✅ **6. What is the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)?**

**Answer:**
STLC refers to the sequence of activities conducted during testing:

1. Requirement Analysis
2. Test Planning
3. Test Case Design
4. Test Environment Setup
5. Test Execution
6. Test Cycle Closure

### ✅ **7. What is the Difference Between Severity and Priority?**

| **Severity**                                   | **Priority**                          |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Describes the impact of the bug on the system. | Describes the urgency to fix the bug. |
| Set by the tester.                             | Set by the developer or manager.      |

### ✅ **8. What are the Types of Manual Testing?**

**Answer:**

* Smoke Testing
* Sanity Testing
* Functional Testing
* Regression Testing
* Integration Testing
* User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
* System Testing
* Exploratory Testing

---

### ✅ **9. What is Regression Testing?**

**Answer:**
Regression Testing is performed to confirm that a recent code change has not affected the existing functionality of the application.

---

### ✅ **10. What is the Difference Between Test Plan and Test Strategy?**

| **Test Plan**                                     | **Test Strategy**                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Detailed document for testing a specific project. | High-level approach used across multiple projects. |
| Created by test lead/test manager.                | Created by project manager or QA head.             |

---

### ✅ **11. What is a Test Scenario?**

**Answer:**
A test scenario is a high-level description of what to test. It's a one-liner explaining a functionality to be tested (e.g., “Check login functionality with valid credentials”).

---

### ✅ **12. What is Exploratory Testing?**

**Answer:**
Exploratory Testing is simultaneous learning, test design, and test execution. It is performed without pre-defined test cases, where the tester explores the application freely.

---

### ✅ **13. What is a Use Case?**

**Answer:**
A use case describes how a user interacts with a system to achieve a goal. It includes the steps a user takes and the system’s response.

---

### ✅ **14. What is UAT (User Acceptance Testing)?**

**Answer:**
UAT is the final testing phase where actual users test the software to ensure it can handle required tasks in real-world scenarios.

---

### ✅ **15. What are Positive and Negative Testing?**

* **Positive Testing**: Testing with valid inputs to verify the system behaves correctly.
* **Negative Testing**: Testing with invalid inputs to check how the system handles errors.
